# Supplementary Information for Global Network Control from Local Information
by Aleksandar Haber, Ferenc Molnar, and Adilson E. Motter

## Contents of this Repository

### [Adjacency]
Network adjacency information for the Iceland network and a representative random geometric network (RGN) in edge-list format. 
In the files, each line indicates an edge identified by the two node labels (the incident nodes).

### [Figures_Iceland]
State Information Neighborhood (SIN) Plots for the Iceland network. 

Each file is labelled by the central node of the SIN.

Network parameters:
- Number of nodes = 224
- Number of edges = 238

SIN parameters:
- f = 2
- q = 2

### [Figures_RGN]
State Information Neighborhood (SIN) Plots for the RGN. 

Each file is labelled by the central node of the SIN.

Network parameters:
- Number of nodes = 702
- Number of edges = 3390

SIN parameters:
- f = 5
- q = 3
